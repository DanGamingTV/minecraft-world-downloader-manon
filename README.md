# minecraft-world-downloader
A Minecraft world downloader that works by intercepting & decrypting network traffic between the client and the server to read & save chunk data. Chunks can be sent back to the client to extend the render distance.

### Requirements
- Java 17 or higher
- Minecraft version 1.12.2+ // 1.13.2+ // 1.14.1+ // 1.15.2+ // 1.16.2+ // 1.17+ // 1.18+ // 1.19+

### Basic usage
[Download](https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/releases/latest/download/world-downloader.exe) the latest release and run it. Enter the server address in the address field and press start. Instead of connecting to the server itself, connect to `localhost` in Minecraft to start downloading the world.

Additional settings can be changed in the other tabs of the settings window.

If you run into any problems, check the [FAQ](https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/wiki/FAQ) page for some common issues. 


### Command-line
[Download](https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/releases/latest/download/world-downloader.jar) the cross-platform `world-downloader.jar` and run it using the command-line:

```
java -jar world-downloader.jar -s address.to.server.com
```

Then connect to ```localhost``` in Minecraft to start downloading the world. The world will be saved to the ```world/``` by default.

Other arguments can be specified to change the behaviour of the downloader. For example, render distance extending can be enabled by setting the render distance with `-r [distance]`:
```
java -jar world-downloader.jar -s address.to.server.com -r 16
```

### Running on Linux
To easily download the latest release using the terminal, the following commands can be used:
```
wget https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/releases/latest/download/world-downloader.jar
java -jar world-downloader.jar -s address.to.server.com
